#  myseed

An angularjs, requirejs, coffeescript, zurb-foundation, gulp  seed project for my personal needs.

### inside

*  angularjs + requirejs = [angularAMD](http://marcoslin.github.io/angularAMD)
*  coffee script all the way
*  gulp for build system'
*  zurb-foundation and libsass for css framework

### why

I was tired of not having my personal seed project to make small projects looks like professional ones.
